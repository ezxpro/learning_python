1. Dictionaries are made of **a key** and a **value**
2. Dictionaries are known as dictionaries or mappings

- A dictionary key must be str or int
- A dictionary value can have any other data type

## Built-in operations for dictionaries
- `len(d)`: returns # of stored entries
- `del d[key]`: deletes key k with its values
- `key in d`: True if key k exists in dictionary d
- `key not in d`: True if key K doesn't exist in dictionary d
